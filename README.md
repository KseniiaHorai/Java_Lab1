# Lab1: Java Array Operations

## Objective
The goal is to develop skills in using arrays effectively in Java.

## Tasks

### Matrix Operations 
- **1**: \( C = A x B \) (matrix multiplication)
- **2**: `int`
- **3**: Find the average of each row's elements.

### Implementation
A class will be created that includes an execution method to perform **matrix multiplication**, based on the determined element type - **int**. The results of the calculations will be printed to the console. All exceptions that may occur during code execution will be handled properly. All variables will be clearly defined, and their values will be assigned within the execution method. We will also find **the average of each row's elements**.

### Coding Standards
The code will adhere to Java Code Conventions (or Google Java Style Guide) to ensure readability and maintainability.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Run the program:
```cmd
  mvn clean install
  java -cp target/Lab1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.example.Lab1Horai
```
